# GameDev-Fall-2024
  Repo for the fall 2024 term of game dev

MAYA LAB01
  For this lab I showed my human character I made. She is an emo farmgirl with overalls, hat, boots, and earrings. The biggest challenge modeling her was figuring out how make her overalls. I used my drawing as a reference in the background and messed with it until it fit onto the model. I did a lot of hand painting texturing for some of the details like the skull and pockets. 

MAYA LAB02 
  For this lab I used my whale shark rig. It is a stylized whale shark model that is fully rigged and skinned. It is all FK as whales dont really have anything that needs IK.
