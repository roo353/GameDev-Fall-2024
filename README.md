MAYA LAB01
  For this lab I showed my human character I made. She is an emo farmgirl with overalls, hat, boots, and earrings. The biggest challenge modeling her was figuring out how make her overalls. I used my drawing as a reference in the background and messed with it until it fit onto the model. I did a lot of hand painting texturing for some of the details like the skull and pockets.
